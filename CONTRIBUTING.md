# Contributing to MedViT-CAMIL

First off, thank you for considering contributing to MedViT-CAMIL! It's researchers like you that make our architecture better.

## Professional Conduct

As this is a research-oriented project, we maintain a professional and objective communication style. All technical discussions should be data-driven and maintain scientific rigor.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub Issues.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.
- Include a **reproducible example** (using mode TEST or PROXY).
- Describe the expected behavior and the actual behavior.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open an issue to discuss the enhancement before implementation.
- Provide a scientific rationale for the change (e.g., performance improvement, reduced complexity).
- If suggesting a new backbone, ensure it is compatible with the "frozen weights" strategy.

### Code Contributions

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5.  Open a Pull Request.

## Technical Standards

### Coding Style

- **Python**: Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standards.
- **Documentation**: Use docstrings for all classes and functions. Maintain the LaTeX-compatible documentation in the `doc/` folder if architectural changes are made.
- **Dependencies**: Minimize core dependencies. Use `requirements.txt` only for necessary library updates.

### Experiment Validation

Any contribution proposing a change in performance **must** include:

1.  The JSON result file generated by the `src/main.py` script.
2.  Updated visualization plots (`training_curves.png` and `attention_heatmap.png`).
3.  Verification that the change does not break the **Execution Protocol** (TEST/PROXY/REAL).

## Research Policy

If you use this code for a scientific publication, please acknowledge the authors as per the license and cite the relevant references provided in the `README.md`.
